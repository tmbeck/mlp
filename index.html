Welcome! This site is a place for me to keep track of my experiences learning machine learning, including material covered in the excellent [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) courses. This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), An easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
