## Welcome! 
This site is a place for me to keep track of my experiences learning machine learning, including material covered in the excellent [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) courses. This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks, so I can better record my journey and demonstrate my progress.

### Who am I?

My name is [Tim Beck and I'm an engineer]({{site.baseurl}}/about/).
