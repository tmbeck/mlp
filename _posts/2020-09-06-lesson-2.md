# Questionnaire

22. Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?

    * If we used a random sample for validation, then repeated training (e.g. resampling the random data set and training the model on the resampled data) we could overfit our model.
    * If we use a static sample for validation, then repeated training won't be able to overfit, because it will never learn from the validation set.
    * For example, with time series data we may hold out a specific period (say the last two weeks) of data as a validation set, rather than a random sampling of the dataset..

23. What is overfitting? Provide an example.

    * Overfitting is the process of a model "memorizing" a given dataset. This can happen when our learning rate continues to increase and our error rate tends to zero. For example, if you overtrained a model on your entire dataset of cats, it would not be able to perform inference on new cat photos it has never seen before.

24. What is a metric? How does it differ from "loss"?

    * A metric is all we care about: it is how well our model performs on our validation set. 

25. How can pretrained models help?

26. What is the "head" of a model?

27. What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers?

28. Are image models only useful for photos?

29. What is an "architecture"?

30. What is segmentation?

31. What is y_range used for? When do we need it?

32. What are "hyperparameters"?

33. What's the best way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization?
