            "title": "Fossil Dataset Construction",
            "content": "Introduction . I hacked together most of this code in between completing the first few lessons from the fastai course v3. The final product is a site I host internally so that my local paleontologist can label data for me. :) . This was the first big step in one of my projects. The objective of this notebook was to learn about the reddit API and build a dataset I could use to train a model using the resnet architecture. It also helped me validate my home setup was complete. . What it didn&#39;t teach me is how to integrate with the broader community, which is another reason I wanted to create this blog. . #hide_output import os import sys import re import glob from pathlib import Path import numpy as np import pandas as pd import requests # For generating the widgets import ipywidgets as widgets from ipywidgets import interact, interact_manual from IPython.display import clear_output, display, Image as Img from IPython.core.display import HTML import ipyplot from fastai.vision import * from fastai.vision import core # For interacting with reddit import praw from praw.models import MoreComments # For managing our reddit secrets from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() . Data Organization . To get started, we will follow the example in the first lessons by using a dataset that is labeled by the directory name. We will store images in the path below, which we will also use for training with fastai. . In this case, images are saved to the path /home/tbeck/src/data/fossils. fastai saves the images using an 8-digit, zero filled identifier. This code does not check for duplicates and does not allow the user to review the existing dataset (e.g. to clean it), although there are some tools now with fastai that might be useful for that purpose. . dataset_path = Path(&#39;/home/tbeck/src/data/fossils&#39;) labels = [x.name for x in dataset_path.iterdir() if (x.is_dir() and x.name not in [&#39;models&#39;])] . PRAW . We must instantiate the reddit PRAW client, so we do so by passing it environment variables loaded from a .env file via the python-dotenv package. Using the API, we can obtain URLs to posted images and scrape the reddit comments (useful for getting hints). . reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id=os.environ[&#39;REDDIT_CLIENT_ID&#39;], client_secret=os.environ[&#39;REDDIT_SECRET&#39;], password=os.environ[&#39;REDDIT_PASSWORD&#39;], user_agent=os.environ[&#39;REDDIT_USER_AGENT&#39;], username=os.environ[&#39;REDDIT_USERNAME&#39;]) fossilid = reddit.subreddit(&#39;fossilid&#39;) . We need some helper functions to retrieve the images and save them to our dataset. I found that URLs obtained from reddit need some post processing, otherwise they do not render properly. . def download_image(url, dest=None): &quot;&quot;&quot;Given a URL, saves the image in a format the fastai likes.&quot;&quot;&quot; dest = Path(dest) dest.mkdir(exist_ok=True) files = glob.glob(os.path.join(dest, &#39;*.jpg&#39;)) + glob.glob(os.path.join(dest, &#39;*.png&#39;)) i = len(files) suffix = re.findall(r&#39; . w+?(?=(?: ?|$))&#39;, url) suffix = suffix[0] if len(suffix)&gt;0 else &#39;.jpg&#39; try: core.download_url(url, dest/f&quot;{i:08d}{suffix}&quot;, overwrite=True, show_progress=False) except Exception as e: f&quot;Couldn&#39;t download {url}.&quot; def get_image(url, verbose=False): &quot;&quot;&quot;Given a URL, returns the URL if it looks like it&#39;s a URL to an image&quot;&quot;&quot; IMG_TEST = &quot; .(jpg|png)&quot; p = re.compile(IMG_TEST, re.IGNORECASE) if p.search(url): if verbose: print(&quot;url to image&quot;) return url IMGUR_LINK_TEST = r&quot;((http|https)://imgur.com/[a-z0-9]+)$&quot; p = re.compile(IMGUR_LINK_TEST, re.IGNORECASE) if p.search(url): if verbose: print(&quot;imgur without extension&quot;) return url + &#39;.jpg&#39; IMGUR_REGEX_TEST = r&quot;((http|https)://i.imgur.com/[a-z0-9 .]+?(jpg|png))&quot; p = re.compile(IMGUR_REGEX_TEST, re.IGNORECASE) if p.search(url): if verbose: print(&quot;imgur with extension&quot;) return url return None class Error(Exception): def __init__(self, msg): self.msg = msg class SubmissionStickiedError(Error): pass class SubmissionIsVideoError(Error): pass class SubmissionNotAnImageError(Error): pass class DisplayError(Error): pass . Now we can query reddit for the images. The method below to build the dataset is a little clunky (I create arrays for each column of data and take great steps to be sure they are equal length). A better way would be to delegate creating this data structure to a single function so that the code below is less complex. . # Fetch submissions for analysis and initialize parallel arrays submissions = [] images = [] top_comments = [] errors = [] verbose = False for i, submission in enumerate(reddit.subreddit(&quot;fossilid&quot;).new(limit=None)): submissions.append(submission) images.append(None) top_comments.append(None) errors.append(None) try: if submission.stickied: raise SubmissionStickiedError(&quot;Post is stickied&quot;) if submission.is_video: raise SubmissionIsVideoError(&quot;Post is a video&quot;) if get_image(submission.url): if verbose: print(f&quot;Title: {submission.title}&quot;) images[i] = get_image(submission.url) try: if verbose: display(Img(get_image(submission.url), retina=False, height=400, width=400)) except Exception as err: if verbose: print(f&quot;Failed to retrieve transformed image url {get_image(submission.url)} from submission url {submission.url}&quot;) raise DisplayError(f&quot;Failed to retrieve transformed image url {get_image(submission.url)} from submission url {submission.url}&quot;) submission.comments.replace_more(limit=None) for top_level_comment in submission.comments: if verbose: print(f&quot;Comment: t{top_level_comment.body}&quot;) top_comments[i] = top_level_comment.body break else: raise SubmissionNotAnImageError(&quot;Post is not a recognized image url&quot;) except Exception as err: submissions[i] = None images[i] = None top_comments[i] = None errors[i] = err.msg df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;submissions&#39;: submissions, &#39;images&#39;: images, &#39;comments&#39;: top_comments, &#39;errors&#39;: errors}) df.dropna(how=&#39;all&#39;, inplace=True) df.dropna(subset=[&#39;images&#39;], inplace=True) .

Widgets . To build the dataset and gain context, I created a custom widget for my local paleontologist to use. Here, she can easily navigate the images and apply labels. This widget was a composite of multiple ipywidgets to appear as a single form: . A slider so they can quickly jump between submissions | Drop down and text fields that can be populated with fixed or freeform data | Buttons for saving data, advancing, and resetting the form. | . In addition, I show the reddit comment using a label as a hint to the user. . When the widget is rendered, it uses the DataFrame to retrieve the image from the url. . The &#39;Class&#39; dropdown is created from the labels loaded above. When &#39;New Class&#39; is not empty and &#39;Save&#39; is pressed, a new directory is created (if needed) and the image is saved there using fastai (see download_image()). . Here is what the widget ends up looking like: . Reviewing The Dataset . Because the data is stored in a DataFrame, we can easily manipulate the information we&#39;ve scraped. The ipyplot package is useful for generating thumbnails from a series of urls. This makes it easy to quickly review what&#39;s been scraped. . ipyplot.plot_images(df[&#39;images&#39;], max_images=80, img_width=100) . Lessons Learned . Functionality here is somewhat similar to what other widgets can do, such as superintendent. But this was a good exercise to dust off my ipywidget skills, experiment with interacting with reddit&#39;s API, and building a custom dataset using fastai. . I built this notebook when fastai&#39;s course v3 was still out, when Google images was being scraped rather than the Bing search API being used. .",

            "content": "The Story so Far . Ok, so this all started around July 2020 when I decided to invest in my own education and learn more about what some of my team members were working on. One of them suggested fast.ai so I decided to give it a try. . At the time, the course v3 was in “production”. Since then, v4 has been released. . Setup . Being the hands on engineer that I am, I decided to build my own system for machine learning from spare parts around the house. I already have experience deploying jupyter for use by development teams and I am no stranger to Linux. The fast.ai Getting Started guide originally suggested using managed services such as Google Cloud or AWS, but it was straightforward enough to get something working that I’ve documented it below. . Note that this isn’t recommended by Jeremy in the video lesson, but I decided to do it to understand what is going on behind the scenes (and why pay AWS when I have the hardware and free solar energy). . Hardware . These are parts I had laying around the house. The key if you want GPU acceleration with pytorch is to have the right GPU; too old and your GPU won’t support the necessary GPU compute capabilities. Below is the harware I had on hand: . Intel i7-4770 | 32 GB of RAM | NVIDIA Corporation GM204 [GeForce GTX 970] (rev a1); GPU compute capability 5.2 | 1 TB SSD (actually an upgrade; spinning rust was unbearably slow due to the low number of random IOPS) | . Software . Linux is my preferred operating system in general for hacking, so I went with the recently released Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Server. . I’ve been using anaconda as my python distribution of choice for many years now, so I grabbed the python 3.8 x86_64 for Linux package. . I also grabbed docker.io. Nvidia has a solution for doing GPU compute that requires docker to be installed, as well. . Since fastai uses pytorch, and pytorch only support CPU or GPU via cudatoolkit, I needed the nvidia.ko kernel module, the necessary nvidia cuda toolkit libraries, and the right packages in a conda environment. . I installed nvidia-dkms-450 to provide nvidia drivers for my GTX 970. . Nvidia provides a CUDA toolkit 10.2 Ubuntu repo. Even though it says 18.04, it worked fine for me on 20.04. Just follow the instructions to install the cuda package. . You might also find the NVIDIA CUDA Installation Guide for Linux helpful for troubleshooting installation issues. . Reboot as needed. . Integration &amp; Test . Finally we can create a new conda environment, install the necessary packages, and verify pytorch can see and use the GPU. . Create a fastai conda environment with python 3.8 . $ conda create -n fastai python=3.8 $ conda activate fastai . | Install fastai in conda, as per their Install Instructions.

If you have multiple GPU’s installed, you may need to specify which one to use. Check out this stack overflow article on how to set the appropriate environment variables for the command line and for jupyter to work. . A note on updates . I’ve noticed that if you update conda using conda update --all, it will try to pull in the latest version of cudatoolkit, which as of this writing is cudatoolkit-11.0.221-h6bb024c_0. This is safe to do, but you will need to downgrade back to cudatoolkit-10.2. Below is an example. . Upgrading conda (only showing cudatoolkit for visbility - your output will differ) . $ conda update --all ... The following packages will be UPDATED: cudatoolkit anaconda::cudatoolkit-10.2.89-hfd86e8~ --&gt; pkgs/main::cudatoolkit-11.0.221-h6bb024c_0 .

Note that trying to install cudatoolkit=10.2 alone might result in this error, so be sure that pytorch and torchvision are included when specifying cudatoolkit=10.2. . Preparing for class . There are two sets of notebooks for the class: . The fastbook, a guided set of notebooks with prose for following along in the videos: fastbook | The same notebooks as a study aid: course-v4 | . Please consider showing your support by buying the fastbook: Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD . I setup my own area for hacking: . $ mkdir ~/src $ cd ~/src &amp;&amp; git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastbook.git &amp;&amp; git clone https://github.com/fastai/course-v4.git . Now that CUDA is working and we have the code, I prefer fire up my jupyter notebook in a screen session. To do this I generated a https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html via jupyte notebook --generate-config and wrote it to ~/.jupyter/jupyte_notebook_config.py. Then I made it listen on 0.0.0.0 so I can reach it from my LAN (or anywhere in the world via wireguard!). . Now I just run screen, activate conda with conda activate fastai, and finally start jupyter with jupyter notebook. For tricks on using screen see this quickreference . If you prefer to use jupyter lab, you’ll need to conda install jupyterlab and run jupyter lab instead. .",

Discussed what’s needed to take this course (not much!). | Discussed history of AI and how deep neural networks came to be. Mostly news to me, 1/10. | Introduced Jupyter, ipywidgets, REPL. Mostly seen this before, 7/10. | Introduced ML (repeat, but still new, 4/10) take an input, process it, get an output. | Samuel’s terminology: take inputs &amp; weights into a model, generate results | Add feedback: measure performance of the results (a metric), then change weights. Rinse &amp; repeat. | Different weights to the model allows it to do a different task | Universal approximation theorem: theory that a neural network could solve any problem to any level of accuracy. | Need a way to update weights - SGD: stochastic gradient descent - to update the weights | . | ML Limitations . A model can only be created from data | A model can only learn from patterns in the inputs | A model can only make a prediction - actions happen externally | . Labeled data is key and often missing - good part, bad part, etc. . It is important to note that a feedback loop can be created, resulting in a causal relationship where none existed before.

Here cnn_learner is a function that generates our model, dls is our dataset, resnet34 is our architecture, and error_rate is a loss function for feedback. . resnet34 is a predefined neural network trained on images that is free to use. 34 indicates it has 34 layers, more layers requires more GPU memory. . error_rate is computed on data not used in training, also known as a holdout set or validation set, to help avoid overfitting. Might need to increase the size of the holdout set to avoid overfitting. The ambiguiuty is actually important in model building, otherwise the model will only know how to recognize images it has seen before. . | Other uses . segmentation: figuring out what every pixel in an image is (what label it corresponds to) .

This replaces the previous layer when cnn_learner is used. | . epoch | One complete training of the model on the complete dataset | . Over fitting | When a model learns the unique characteristics of a dataset rather than a generalization, limiting its ability to do inference on new data. | . Howard, Jeremy. Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch . O’Reilly Media. Kindle Edition. . From the loss, we can /update/ the weight for a given input, thus allowing our system to learn. . Homework . Do the questionaire, run the notebooks, etc. . Questionnaire . Some of these questions were answered after watching both videos and reading chapter 1 of the book. Although this blog post is titled lesson 1, chapter 1 is covered in the first two lessons. Since I’m consuming the material one lesson at a time I’ll continue to follow this pattern. . (If you’re not sure of the answer to a question, try watching the next lesson and then coming back to this one, or read the first chapter of the book.) | . Do you need these for deep learning? . Lots of math T / F . False: Much of the math is taken for you thanks to libraries such as numpy. | . Lots of data T / F . False: Relatively small data sets can train world class models - no need for “Big Data”! Lots of expensive computers T / F . | False: You can use consumer grade hardware if you have it or take advantage of Google Cloud, AWS, Colab, etc. . | . A PhD T / F . False: You will need some knowledge of programming and understanding of your data set, but a PhD is not needed. | . | Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world. . NLP (natural language processing) | Computer Vision | Medicine | Biology | Image generalization | Forecasting | Robotics (grip strength, movement) | | What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron? . | The Mark I Perceptron (sounds like something from Fallout!) . Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)? . A set of processing units | A state of activation | An output function for each unit | A pattern of connectivity between units | A propagation rule for patterns to pass between units via a pattern of connectivity | An activation rule that controls the output for a given input and current state of a unit | A learning rule that modifies patterns of connectivity | An environment to operate in (often overlooked) | . | What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks? . That because a single layer of neurons could not simulate an XOR, neural networks were a dead end | DNN would be too big and too slow to be useful | . | What is a GPU? . A Graphcis Processing Unit, designed for massively parallel execution of floating point vectors. | . | Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: 1+1. What happens? . It computes and displays the output (2) | . | Follow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter. Before executing each cell, guess what will happen. . Done in the notebook… | . | Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix. . Done | . | Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo? . Requires a pixel by pixel search of the image, or something akin to a kernel to review pixel groupings, with significant comparison and cyclic complexity. Here, we tell the computer what to think, when to think it - we are explicit. This is converse to machine learning, which learns the patterns in the data and uses those patterns to recognize images in a photo. | . | What did Samuel mean by “weight assignment”? . Weight assignments are variables used in a model to alter the performance of the program (model). The weight assignments must have an automatic means to be updated, so as to provide feedback to improve the performance of the model for its respective purpose. | . | What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called “weights”? . We call them “parameters”. | . | Draw a picture that summarizes Samuel’s view of a machine learning model. . | * results = model(inputs, weights) * performance = results - actuals * weights = performance(weights) Essentially, the inputs of a model are used to generate results. Those results have a certain performance, which is improved by modifying the weights and repeating the operation. . Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction? . Because of the complexity of the “black box” - it would be necessary to instrument each layer of a neural network in order to understand why. In other words, the why is the entirety of the state machine, although some parts of the state machine may be better than others. | . | What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy? . Universal approximation theorem (reminds me of using taylor series expansion to approximate various mathematical functions) | . | What do you need in order to train a model? . You need a dataset and an architecture (a pretrained model) | . | How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model? . Inherent bias in the dataset could lead to increased policing of a particular population representative of the bias, resulting in additional policing, enhancing the existing dataset bias. | . | Do we always have to use 224×224-pixel images with the cat recognition model? . No, but larger images or sizes may impact performance of the GPU (meaning it will take longer for the model to learn) | . | What is the difference between classification and regression? . Classification predicts the category of a given input (think predicting finite enumerations) | Regression predicts a future numeric value, like the temperature tomorrow | . | What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them? . A validation or hold out set is a subset of a dataset that we do not train the model with, but we use to grade the model’s performance. | A test set is a dataset we do not show even ourselves, to avoid introducing bias through EDA and model training. | We need these to avoid overfitting or introducing bias into our models | . | What will fastai do if you don’t provide a validation set? . It will automatically use a subset of your data as the validation set. | . | Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not? . If we used a random sample for validation, then repeated training (e.g. resampling the random data set and training the model on the resampled data) we could overfit our model. | If we use a static sample for validation, then repeated training won’t be able to overfit, because it will never learn from the validation set. | For example, with time series data we may hold out a specific period (say the last two weeks) of data as a validation set, rather than a random sampling of the dataset.. | . | What is overfitting? Provide an example. . Overfitting is the process of a model “memorizing” a given dataset. This can happen when our learning rate continues to increase and our error rate tends to zero. For example, if you overtrained a model on your entire dataset of cats, it would not be able to perform inference on new cat photos it has never seen before. | . | What is a metric? How does it differ from “loss”? . A metric is all we care about: it is how well our model performs on our validation set. | . | How can pretrained models help? . Pretrained models can be used to train a new model (transfer learning) | . | What is the “head” of a model? . The head of the model is the layer who’s parameters are modified by training | . | What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers? . This depends, but a CNN might first learn things like basic shapes or color gradients. Later layers might recognize repeating patterns or more specific shapes. | . | Are image models only useful for photos? . No! It’s possible to create images from many different types of data, including log files, executables, sound, etc. This can be done by transforming data to grayscale, or using existing visualization techniques (such as FFT). | . | What is an “architecture”? . An architecture is a pretrained model from a specific dataset. resnet is an example of an architecture used in this book for computer vision. | . | What is segmentation? . segmentation is the label of individual pixels of data in an image, e.g. applying the label “car” to the parts of an image with a car in it. | . | What is y_range used for? When do we need it? . y_range | . | What are “hyperparameters”? . A hyperparameter is a parameter about a parameter. When choosing new hyper parameters we must be careful or we may inadvertently introduce bias or overfitting the validation data, basically “finding the answer we want to hear”. | . | What’s the best way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization? . To understand why a validation and test data set are needed and to ensure they are properly used when developing a model. | . |",

          "content": ". Timothy Beck I recieved a degree in Electrical Engineering from UCSD in 2007. I’ve worked most of my engineering career at Viasat, where I’ve enjoyed career mobility by being a test engineer, software engineer, and hardware engineer, later becoming a cross-functional leader of an engineering organization comprised of mechanical, hardware (including programmable logic), and software engineers. Much of my careeer has been focused on constructing what would now be considered “well-labeled datasets”, as well as web-based analysis tools for computing process capability metrics, supporting root cause analysis, providing insight into product performance, general process automation, etc. . . Since learning more about data science and machine learning, I’ve begun exploring the intersection of ML and manufacturing, particularly how ML can accelerate manufacturing &amp; test processes. I feel passionately that this technology can be used to improve product design by providing greater context and understanding by combining manufacturing, test, and operational datasets. . I first started diving into machine learning myself using the fast.ai v3 course, but switched to v4 of the course when it was recently released. In Lesson 3 of v4 of the course, Jeremy recommends to write about what you are learning. Once I saw fastpages1, I figured it was time to start writing. They had me once I found out I could convert jupyter notebooks to blog posts! . I created this site to help me document my journey, study, challenge myself, and show off what I’ve learned. . This website is powered by fastpages1. .

Subreddit r/fossils frequently has posts such as this one, asking for identification (there is another subreddit, r/fossilid, for this purpose). Could we train a model to classify such images? . Hypothesis: A machine learning model could ultimately be used by the scientific community to identify species, provided a sufficiently large dataset. . Objective: Train a model that can recognize fossils. Create a reddit bot that can reply to posts with classifications, allowing for replies on various subreddits that can help train the model. . Background: For obvious reasons, idenification and taxonomy are important topics for paleontologists. Here, I will train a model using labels that provide as much or more detail as class, as per modern taxonomic classification, with the ultimate goal that a model can identify a specific species (or conversely, identify a species it does not recognise). . See Trilobite evolutionary rates constrain the duration of the Cambrian explosion for how trilobites are classified. A model trained on sufficiently large data set should be able to identify an entire class (e.g. it can identify a fossil’s species if that fossil is known in class trilobita). . Methodology: To do this, I use the same subreddits as a source for material in order to build a dataset. The model will use resnet34 as its architecture. I build upon my growing knowledge from the fastai courses to achieve this. . Exploration . Based on the experience creating a model that can identify teddies (fastai course v3), then cats vs. dogs (course v4), this is plausible but we will need to build a dataset. . Began by investigating solutions for scraping images off reddit. . Initial solution: use ParseHub to scrape reddit and download images. Pros Low code, visually build scraping logic | Output can be automated and available in CSV via API | . | Cons Eventually, not free | Results inconsistent, particularly with the “new” reddit site layout | Slow (unless you pay for it) | Costs $$$ | . | . Tried this solution. Limited success, thanks to a number of tutorials out there showing how to scrape old.reddit.com. This is a no go. . | Better solution: use praw, tutorial here and here on towardsdatascience. Obtain API creds, write own scraping logic. Build into a notebook. | Ideas for new projects .
